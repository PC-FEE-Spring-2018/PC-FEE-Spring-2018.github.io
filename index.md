# Las Vegas Front-end Engineering Pre-work
Three months is a short amount of time to teach you everything you need to know to be a great front-end developer. To make sure that we can move as fast as possible and cover all of the topics that we need to cover, here's a list of exercises and reading materials to get you up to speed. Please complete this work before the first day of class.

I expect you to be able to complete these exercises on your own. but if you run into trouble you're welcome to email me: [mike@punchcode.org](mailto:mike@punchcode.org).

### HTML/CSS:
HTML and CSS are the foundation of all the content of a webpage or web app. However, we will only be spending about one to two weeks on HTML and CSS, so having a basic foundation before class will be very helpful.

Complete the Codecademy course at [http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web). This should take you approximately 7 hours, depending on your prior experience.


### JavaScript:
We will spend most of our time talking about JavaScript. JavaScript allows us to add interaction to our web applications.

Complete the Codecademy course at [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript). You don't need the pro version.

This is not how our course will be taught ­­but it’s great to get yourself as familiar as possible with some of the syntax of the language.

### Command Line
Mastery of command line basics is essential for any developer (and extremely useful for non­devs) and will make your life much easier. Go through the following tutorial, paying special attention to the instructions to create notecards for memorization. You won't have to memorize many things in this course, but memorizing command line commands is essential: [https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line)

### Software
Before starting at PunchCode you will need a few pieces of free software. Please download and install the following software.

1. Download and install [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). This is one of the tools we will use to write code.
2. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Yet another code editor.
3. Download the latest Vesrsion of OSX from the Apple Store: [High Sierra](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?mt=12&l=en-us&ls=1). WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.
4. Have the latest version of [Google Chrome installed](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)

Add google chrome and sublime to your dock.


### Accounts
We will use a couple of online services throughout during the class. Please create accounts on these services so that you're ready to rock on day 1.

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com). Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name.

2. You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).


### Basic OS X Skills (optional)
If this is your first time using a Mac it might slow you down at first. It's important to get as comfortable as possible with your laptop before class. If this is your first time using a mac, or you need to brush up on some of your basic computer skills read through these tutorials:
